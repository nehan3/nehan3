<p><b><font face = "Century Gothic" color = "233548" size = "4">
 My name is Neha Nagar and I am currently a freshman at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br>
 majoring in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering with the hopes of minoring in computer science.<br> <br>
 
 My history with computer science began the summer before 5th grade, where I made my first website with HTML.<br>
 Although extremely simple, it gave me a glimpse into the world of coding. My next encounter with coding<br>
 happened in my junior year of high school, where I took Computer Science 1 and AP Computer Science.<br>
 I was exposed to Java and got to breifly explore other languages.<br><br>
 
 Although my passion for chemical sciences and biotech outshined that of programming, I am still very<br>
 interested in the field and hope to deepen my knowledge through a minor. In the future, I wish to <br>
 work in the pharmaceutical or biotech industry with the hopes of being able to merge my two interests.
